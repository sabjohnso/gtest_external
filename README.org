#+TITLE: GTest External

* Overview

  This repository provides a CMakeList.txt file for building GTest as an external
  project and defines targets that can be linked where needed for testing. The
  intention is for this repositor to be consumed as a git submodule.

* Known issues

  No effor was made or is planned to make this solution portable to Window

* Targets
  Only one of the provided targets needs to be linked to a test executable

   - google::test :: GTest library
   - google::test_main :: GTest library + the main function to run all linked tests
   - google::mock :: GTest library + GMock library 
   - google::mock_main :: GTest library + GMock library + the main function to run all linked tests

* How to use

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git submodule add --recursive https://github.com/sabjohnso/gtest_external.git gtest_external
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC cmake
    add_subdirectory( gtest_external )
